intro: |
  In the same year of enrollment, I became a mom. Parenting and simultaneously pursuing a doctorate degree is a supreme challenge, but it taught me to make use of small pockets of time and work in more creative ways.
  
  I continue to pursue a life that is devoted to being a researcher and a teacher, and "growing others".
