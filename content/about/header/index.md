  Hi, I am Fuhe. Welcome

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

After a decade-long career in multiple business organizations (2008-2018), I begin to pursue a PhD. in Leadership and Organizational Science to fulfill my passion for learning, sharing knowledge, and expanding my global insights. 

In the same year of enrollment, I became a mom. Parenting and simultaneously pursuing a doctorate degree is a supreme challenge, but it taught me to use small pockets of time and work in more creative ways. 

I’m grateful and value my time here at Binghamton University. The last three years of inquiry and learning have led me down a research path in which I leverage various research methods to study interpersonal dynamics and leadership in changing organizational contexts. 

As for my future career, I’m devoted to becoming a researcher and educator who can advance knowledge and inspire others.
