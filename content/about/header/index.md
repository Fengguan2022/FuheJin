  Hi, I am Fuhe. Welcome

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

After a decade-long career in multiple business organizations (2008-2018), I begin to pursue a PhD. in Leadership and Organizational Science at Binghamton University. 

In the same year of enrollment, I became a mom. 

Parenting and simultaneously pursuing a doctorate degree is a supreme challenge, but it taught me to make use of small pockets of time and work in more creative ways. 

Iâ€™m devoted to become a researcher AND teacher, better able to "grow others."
