<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I am a Mom, a PhD candidate, and a Course Instructor... yep, multitasking is my survival mechanism. 

After a decade-long career in multiple business organizations (2008-2018), I begin to pursue a PhD. in Leadership and Organizational science at Binghamton University.
