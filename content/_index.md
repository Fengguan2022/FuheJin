description: I am a Ph.D. candidate, a Course Instructor, and a Mom... yep, multitasking is my survival mechanism. I am interested in applying advanced research methods and multilevel perspectives to understand group dynamics and leadership in organizations. I am particularly interested in studying leadership in virtual groups. I am devoted to become a researcher AND teacher, better able to "grow others."
