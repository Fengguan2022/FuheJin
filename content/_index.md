description: I am a Ph.D. candidate, a Course Instructor, and a Mom... yep, multitasking is my survival mechanism. I am interested in applying advanced research methods and multilevel perspectives to understand group dynamics and leadership in organizations. I am particularly interested in studying leadership in virtual groups. I’m devoted to becoming a researcher and educator who can advance knowledge and inspire others.
