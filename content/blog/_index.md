  description: "*'Professor Jin is very knowledgeable about management and clearly very passionate about the topic and taught the content well. Loved her teaching style and how much she cared for her students. Would love to take another class with her again.*' <Br> <Br>'*Very kind and caring instructor. I enjoyed the most parts of the course. She goes at a good pace in lectures. The individual data project was thoughtfully explained in class, and she made it easy to complete the project with the numerous resources offered. The team project was okay, group members were quite easy to work with*'.<Br> <Br>'*Very kind person who seems passionate about the subject. Lenient grader and genuinely seems like she wants us to do well in the class. Group work was annoying but really not too bad/intensive. Datacamp/coding stuff was also annoying but the final project was easy as she posted an example you could easily follow. Pop quizzes based solely on textbook*'.<Br> <Br> -- Excerpt from '[Ratemyprofessors.com](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2749588 )'"
