  description: "*'This course was amazing. It reminded me heavily of psychology, but business orientated. It was very interesting to learn about how people react and work in a business setting whether it is as an individual or as a group. I think the group project was a great addition to the class because it really helped push me out of my comfort zone and challenge me.*' <Br> <Br>'*I learned a lot about organizational behavior and how these concepts apply in the workplace. Working in teams is super critical in the business world, and it is important to realize that people come from different backgrounds. Overall, an amazing course that can be applied to a real-world job setting.*'.<Br> <Br>'*Professor Jin is a great professor. She explains concepts in a way that is easy to understand. I also like how she had a survey for us to fill out about the course and then actually listened to the responses. Her quizzes kept evolving throughout the semester due to our feedback, and she also changed the setting arrangements because of student opinions! Usually, I find that professors don't listen to their students, but this is not true with Professor Jin.*'.<Br> <Br>'*I think Professor Jin is one of the sweetest professors and is very passionate about what she's teaching. She constantly strives to ensure that her students are succeeding and is extremely accommodating. She is always accessible and creates the best slides I have ever seen from a professor. All her content is well organized and very easy on the eyes. I would definitely take a class with her again.*'<Br> <Br> -- Excerpt from 'SOOT Teaching Evaluation for Fuhe Jin'"
