Learning is a lot like exercise. I concur with the view that traditional lecture-based teaching methods are the equivalent of running on a treadmill.

Therefore, I prefer to engage students in dialogue and reinforce course material with interactive activities rather than forcing them to participate in mind-numbing exercises that only the most dedicated fitness enthusiasts will prosper.

Thus, rather than mindlessly running on a metaphorical treadmill, students are engaged in a learning game that is much more fun and rewarding than listening strictly to my talk.<Br><Br>
